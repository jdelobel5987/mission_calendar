# mission_calendar
creation of a dynamic calendar using PHP and integration of events details

This is a small project to exercize coding with PHP language, from the web dev professional formation from the school LaManu (France)

Tasks are:
* making a form with 2 select lists, one for choosing the month and the other for choosing the year (range of +/- 5 years from current year).
* displaying a calendar based on user selection.
* from a Json file containing events details, making events appear at the corresponding date, and display event details.
* improving UX (month/year navigation, highlight current date, weekends...)
